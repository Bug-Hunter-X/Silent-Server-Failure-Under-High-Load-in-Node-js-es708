# Silent Server Failure in Node.js

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Node.js servers: silent failure under high load due to exceeding the operating system's limits on open file descriptors.

## The Bug

The `server.js` file contains a basic HTTP server.  Under normal conditions, it works fine. However, if a large number of concurrent requests are made, the server may stop accepting new connections without producing any error messages in the console. This is because the operating system has a limit on the number of open files, and the server's open file descriptors (related to each open connection) may exceed this limit.

## The Solution

The `server-solution.js` file demonstrates a solution using the `http.Server.close()` method and error handling to gracefully handle connection issues. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node server.js`.
3. Use a load testing tool (like k6 or Apache Bench) to simulate a high volume of concurrent requests to `http://localhost:8080`. Observe that the server might fail silently, with no error messages in the console.
4. Run `node server-solution.js`. This modified version will provide better handling of such situations.
